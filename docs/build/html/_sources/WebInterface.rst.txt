Web Interface
==================================

If you choose, you can skip installing the tool locally all together
and simply use our web interface. An example of the tool on the web is
shown below:

Once you log in, all that is necessary is to upload the appropriate
three files and press go. It will only accept CSV or TXT files. This
will then redirect you to the waiting
screen.

Note: Depending on the number of clusters, this tool will take some
time to run (e.g. 15 clusters -> ~3hours), so do not try to submit
another job while the first is running. Exiting the screen is fine.

Upon completion, COMET will email you your results in zip format, one
email for each cluster input.

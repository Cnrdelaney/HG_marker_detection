# HG_marker_detection
==========================


Installation 
==================================
1. Make sure you are using the correct version of Python


   
   3.5.x & 3.6.x  currently working

   
   
2. Download using pip:

   
   ``pip install HG-Marker-Detection``


   
   Once built this way pip will automatically install dependencies,
   so it is recommended you use some variation of python environment
   (e.g. ``pyenv`` ) to avoid dependency errors.

   

3. Using the tool:


   To run, make sure all your input files are in the current working
   directory. Remember to specify an output location as shown below
   in the 'output/' spot, the easiest approach is to just make a new
   folder in the current directory which can be named arbitrarily.

    Simply call:  
   
   ``hgmd marker_file tsne_file cluster_file output/``

   Using the actual names of your input files and output
   directory. Order DOES matter. The tool will start running and begin
   displaying updates on the terminal.
